  description: "Civil society plays a critical role in governance where laws and authority are weak. We study how a key strategy of international civil society—disseminating information about human rights abuse— impacts multinationals. We consider trends at the center of international campaigns: the assassination of activists, and collect 20 years of data related to murders tied to the global mining sector. Using event study methodology, we estimate the impact of the human rights spotlight on the stock price of firms connected to events. We find that the effect of the human rights spotlight is substantial. Firms named in assassination coverage have large, negative abnormal returns following assassinations. Our estimates imply a median loss in market capitalization of 100 million USD. Meanwhile, these events do not impact the social responsibility (ESG) scores of firms. We show that the media plays a crucial role in these effects: the negative impact of assassinations is strongest when they coincide with calm news cycles versus peak news cycles, when news may be crowded out by large, international stories. In addition, we argue our results are driven by events where companies are explicitly named in the reporting. Last, we show that assassinations are positively related to the royalties paid by mining projects to domestic governments."

  description: "This paper revisits the predicted mortality instrument introduced in the seminal study of Acemoglu and Johnson (2007). Drawing on a unique historical data set of disease-specific mortality rates, we reconstruct several versions of the instrument that differ in terms of data usage and instrument relevance. Our findings confirm its predictive power on life expectancy. The replication analysis reveals a significant positive second-stage effect of life expectancy on population and total birth rates, and a negative effect on GDP per capita for a subset of the revised instruments. Overall, data coverage and empirical tests suggest the superiority of our country-level instrument."

  description: "This study uses a unique and finely-grained data set on social conflict events in Peru and exogenous variation in world mineral prices to show that a surge in projected local mineral rents increases the probability to observe violent confrontations between protesters and the national police. Quantitatively, the results suggest that a 10% increase in the main mineral price leads to a 4.5 percentage point increase in the probability of observing violence against protesters and a 2 percentage point increase in the probability of a protester being killed. I show that a change in protester behavior cannot explain the surge in violence."

# Bio

I am Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [SoDa Labs, Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/business/research/our-research/impact-labs/soda-labs). I work in the fields of political economy, financial economics & development economics. 


My research aims to contribute to a better understanding of [social and environmental conflict arising around projects of multinational corporations in the global periphery](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/environmental-activists/decade-defiance/), where laws are murky and states are weak. A focal point of my research is how civil society can help govern multinational activities in the absence of a central authority.

For my work, I often undertake extensive data collection efforts, for which I make use of national language processing and machine learning methods. I particularly enjoy the use of financial data and methods to answer questions in political economy when other data
is scarce or unreliable.
